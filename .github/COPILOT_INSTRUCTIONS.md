# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Theta Data Downloader

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**NEVER use fake, placeholder, estimated, or synthetic data in anything I ask for.**

This program is for downloading data for real trading. Fake data, estimations, or anything that's not directly from Theta Data causes us financial harm.

**ONLY use real data from Theta Data API calls.**

When I say commit I always mean local and github.  Only do this when I tell you to.
